Abstract. The problem discussed is the relationship between the firing of single 
neurons in sensory pathways and subjectively experienced sensations. The 
conclusions are formulated as the following five dogmas:
1. To understand nervous function one needs to look at interactions at a cellular 
level, rather than either a more macroscopic or microscopic level, because 
behaviour depends upon the organized pattern of these intercellular interactions.
2. The sensory system is organized to achieve as complete a representation of the 
sensory stimulus as possible with the minimum number of active neurons.
3. Trigger features of sensory neurons are matched to redundant patterns of 
stimulation by experience as well as by developmental processes.
4. Perception corresponds to the activity of a small selection from the very 
numerous high-level neurons, each of which corresponds to a pattern of external 
events of the order of complexity of the events symbolized by a word.
5. High impulse frequency in such neurons corresponds to high certainty that the 
trigger feature is present.
The development of the concepts leading up to these speculative dogmas, their 
experimental basis, and some of their limitations are discussed.


1  Introduction
In this article I shall discuss the difficult but challenging problem of the relation 
between our subjective perceptions and the activity of the nerve cells in our 
brains. Results obtained by recording from single neurons in sensory pathways 
have aroused a lot of interest and obviously tell us something important about 
how we sense the world around us; but what exactly have we been told? In order 
to probe this question, ideas that fit current knowledge as well as possible must be 
formulated, and they must be stated clearly enough to be tested to see if they are 
right or wrong; this is what I have tried to do. The central proposition is that our 
perceptions are caused by the activity of a rather small number of neurons 
selected from a very large population of predominantly silent cells. The activity 
of each single cell is thus an important perceptual event and it is thought to be 
related quite simply to our subjective experience. The subtlety and sensitivity of 
perception results from the mechanisms determining when a single cell becomes 
active, rather than from complex combinatorial rules of usage of nerve cells.
In order to avoid vagueness, I have formulated this notion in five definite 
propositions, or dogmas, and the reader who wishes to see the trend of this article 
can glance ahead (to page 380). Some of the dogmas will be readily accepted by 
most people who hope to find a scientific basis for human thought processes, but I 
felt they required statement and discussion in spite of their widespread tacit 
acceptance. Others are more original, will be challenged by many, and have the 
nature of extrapolations from the current trend of results rather than conclusions 
reasonably based upon them. Before these dogmas are stated the developments 
that have led to them will be briefly reviewed. The literature is extensive, and 
much of it will have been incorporated into the reader's common knowledge. My 
aim, therefore, is to pick out the conceptual turning points in order to show the 
direction we are headed. After stating the dogmas, criticisms and alternatives will 
be discussed in an attempt both to justify them and to clarify them further.

2  Recording from single neurons
2.1  Peripheral nerves 
In the twenties and thirties methods were developed for amplifying and recording 
the weak transient electrical potentials associated with the activity of nerve fibres, 
and Adrian and his colleagues used these methods to record the all-or-none 
impulses of single nerve fibres connecting the sense organs to the brain (Adrian, 
1926a, 1926b; Adrian and Zotterman, 1926a, 1926b; Adrian, 1928). They 
showed, for example, that each fibre coming from the skin responded to a 
particular type of stimulus, such as pressure, temperature change, or damage, 
applied to a specific region or receptive field. The frequency of the impulses 
depended upon the intensity of the stimulus, but it was clear that the character of 
the sensation (touch, heat, or pain) depended upon the fibre carrying the message 
not the nature of the message, since this consisted of trains of similar impulses in 
all fibres. Nerves had long been recognized as the link between physical stimulus 
and sensation, so these results provided physiological flesh and blood to the 
skeleton that anatomical studies had revealed a long time earlier.
Most of the results confirmed another ancient idea, namely Müller's doctrine 
of specific nerve energies: the specificity of different sensations stems from the 
responsiveness of different nerve fibres to different types of stimulus. The 
chemical senses proved to be a little different (Pfaffman, 1941, 1955; Ganchrow 
and Erickson, 1970), but in spite of the tact that they did not quite fall in line, the 
concept that resulted from two decades of recording from peripheral fibres and 
following their connections in the brain was of a simple mapping from sense 
organs to sensorium, so that a copy of physical events at the body surface was 
presented to the brain (Bard, 1938; Marshall et al.. 1941; Adrian, 1941, 1947). 
Some modification was recognized to occur for sensory nerves usually adapt to a 
constant stimulus, and therefore signal sudden changes of stimulus energy better 
than sustained levels. Neighbouring receptive fields and modalities were also 
known to overlap, but when the activity of neurons at higher levels in sensory 
pathways was recorded it became obvious that something was happening more 
complex and significant than could be fitted into the concept of simple mapping 
with overlap and adaptation.

2.2  Sensory neurons of the retina 
Starting with Granit (Granit and Svaetichin, 1939; Granit, 1947) and Hartline 
(1938; 1940a, 1940b) in the retina, and Galambos and Davis (Galambos and 
Davis, 1943; Galambos, 1944; Galambos and Davis, 1948) at the periphery of the 
pathway for hearing, a generation of physiologists has studied sensory neurons in 
the central nervous system; all this obviously cannot be reviewed here, but we 
shall concentrate on the results that expanded the conceptual frame built on the 
earlier work. Previously it was possible for physiologists to be satisfied with 
describing how the sense organs and their nerves present a picture of the external 
world to the brain, and they were happy to leave it to the psychologists to discuss 
what happened next; but these next things started to happen around the 
physiologist's micro-electrodes, and he has to join the discussion.
The realization that physiological experiments can answer questions of 
psychological interest first dawned on me personally when I was working on the 
frog¹s retina. A vigorous discharge can be evoked from retinal ganglion cells by 
stimulating the appropriate region of the retinathe ganglion cell's 'receptive 
field' (Hartline, 1940a); but if the surrounding region is simultaneously 
stimulated the response of the cell is diminished or completely abolished (Barlow, 
1953). This phenomenon is called lateral inhibition, or peripheral suppression, 
and such a physiological mechanism had already been postulated in order to 
account for simultaneous brightness and Mach bands (Mach, 1886; Fry, 1948). 
Thus the physiological experiment was really providing evidence in support of a 
psychological hypothesis.
The invasion of psychological territory did not stop at this point. If one 
explains the responsiveness of single ganglion cells in the frog's retina using 
hand-held targets, one finds that one particular type of ganglion cell is most 
effectively driven by something like a black disc subtending a degree or so moved 
rapidly to and fro within the unit's receptive field. This causes a vigorous 
discharge which can be maintained without much decrement as long as the 
movement is continued. Now, if the stimulus which is optimal for this class of 
cells is presented to intact frogs, the behavioural response is often dramatic: they 
turn towards the target and make repeated feeding responses consisting of a jump 
and snap. The selectivity of the retinal neurons, and the frog's reaction when they 
are selectively stimulated, suggest that they are 'bug detectors' (Barlow, 1953) 
performing a primitive but vitally important form of recognition.
This result makes one suddenly realize that a large part of the sensory 
machinery involved in a frog's feeding responses may actually reside in the retina 
rather than in mysterious 'centres' that would be too difficult to understand by 
physiological methods. The essential lock-like property resides in each member 
of a whole class of neurons, and allows the cell to discharge only to the 
appropriate key pattern of sensory stimulation. Lettvin et al. (1959) suggested 
that there were five different classes of cell in the frog, and Levick, Hill and I 
(Barlow et al., 1964) found an even larger number of categories in the rabbit. 
We called these key patterns 'trigger features', and Maturana et al. (1960) 
emphasized another important aspect of the behaviour of these ganglion cells: a 
cell continues to respond to the same trigger feature in spite of changes in light 
intensity over many decades. The properties of the retina are such that a ganglion 
cell can, figuratively speaking, reach out and determine that something specific is 
happening in front of the eye. light is the agent by which it does this but it is the 
detailed pattern of the light that carries the information, and the overall level of 
illumination prevailing at the time is almost totally disregarded.
It is true that Ingle (1968, 1971), Grüsser and Grüsser-Cornehls (1968), and 
Ewert (1970) have shown that it is too simple to suppose that feeding 
automatically and inevitably follows the activation of a certain class of retinal 
ganglion cells by their trigger features; higher coordinating mechanisms are also 
involved. Just as light is only an intermediate agent allowing a retinal ganglion 
cell to detect its trigger feature, so these optic nerve impulses must doubtless be 
regarded as intermediate agents enabling the higher centres to perform their 
tasks. We shall proceed to discuss these problems, but we have gained two 
important concepts from the frog's retina: it transmits a map not of the light 
intensities at each point of the image, but of the trigger features in the world 
before the eye, and its main function is not to transduce different luminance 
levels into different impulse frequencies, but to continue responding invariantly 
to the same external patterns despite changes of average luminance .

2.3 Sensory neurons of the cerebral cortex 
The function of the visual area of the mammalian cerebral cortex is obviously 
more relevant to the problem of our own subjective perceptions than is the frog's 
retina, and Hubel and Wiesel (1959) early discovered examples of selectivity for 
pattern in the responsiveness of cells in the visual cortex of cats. They found that 
a light or dark line, or a dark-light border, was required to evoke a vigorous 
response even in the simplest first-order cells. Furthermore the stimulus had to 
be at a rather precise orientation and position in the visual field and in addition it 
usually had to be moving, often in a specific direction. Hubel and Wiesel (1962) 
also made a distinction between these cells and other classes with more elaborate 
stimulus requirements, which they believed corresponded to cells at later stages 
of information processing. They called these 'complex' and 'hypercomplex' units, 
and showed that they had properties suggesting that the input to each was from 
the simpler category of cells. The fascination of this analysis depends to a large 
extent upon successfully following the way units become selective for more and 
more complex properties at each stage. Some doubts have been cast on their 
hierarchical scheme (Stone, 1972), but it certainly gave new insight into how 
higher levels of categorization are developed from lower levels.
As well as the hierarchical concept, this work provided evidence for a new 
type of invariance. In the cat, as in the frog, the retina is mainly responsible for 
ensuring that the message sent to the brain is not much perturbed by changes in 
ambient illumination. In the cortex Hubel and Wiesel (1962) found that some of 
the higher level neurons responded to the same trigger feature over a 
considerable range of positions. The modality specificity of peripheral neurons 
indicates how one can, for instance, detect warmth at any point on the body 
surface, and we now see that the organized pattern specificity of a set of cortical 
neurons can in the same way produce positional invariance for pattern 
perception. This was previously one of the great puzzles, and, although we 
certainly do not understand how recognition is invariant for position, size, and 
perspective transformations, at least a start has been made.
Later experiments have shown that the primary neurons of the visual cortex 
are more specific in one respect than Hubel and Wiesel originally thought. They 
showed that most neurons are fed by inputs from both eyes, and they emphasized 
that the dominance of ipsi- or contra-lateral eye varied from cell to cell. Now it 
can be shown that a binocular stimulus often has to be very precisely positioned 
in both eyes in order to evoke the most vigorous response (Barlow et al., 1967; 
Pettigrew et al., 1968), and a more important variable than dominance emerges 
from the exact relative positions in the two eyes. Consider what must happen 
when the eyes are converged on some point in front of the cat and appropriate 
visual stimuli are presented; it is easy to position this stimulus correctly for either 
eye by itself, but, if it is to be correctly positioned for both, it will have to be at 
some specific distance from the cat. When the precise positioning for different 
units is studied, it is found that this specific distance for optimal response varies 
in different units in the same cortex, and among units serving the same region of 
visual space. Conversely, the selection of units which are activated provides the 
cat with some information about the distances of the various stimulus objects. In 
uncovering this aspect of the pattern selectivity of sensory neurons we again get 
the sense that a central neuron is reaching out to discover something important 
about what is happening in the real objective world. One even wonders if the line 
and edge detectors of Hubel and Wiesel may not have, as their main function, the 
linking together of information about the same object in the two retinal images in 
order to determine the object's most important coordinate -- its distance from the 
animal. At all events, as in the case of the frog's bug-detector, the importance of 
the information abstracted from the retinal images gives some insight into the 
purpose or direction of the physiological mechanisms.
Something is known about these first steps of information processing in the 
visual cortex; what about the later stages? Results suggesting greater and greater 
specificity of response requirements have been obtained, and a nice example is the 
unit described by Gross et al. (1972) in the infero-temporal cortex of macaques; 
this responded best to stimulation by a figure with many of the specific 
characteristics of a monkey's hand, and the requirements of one such unit are 
well documented. Work in this area is not easy to repeat, for one can readily see 
that it is largely a matter of chance to find a trigger feature of this order of 
complexity. Also, the possibility that cells may retain to adulthood the modifiable 
properties of immature cells that will be described later makes the prospect of 
investigating the sensory association areas an intimidating one.
Cortical neurons receive selective excitatory and inhibitory inputs from other 
neurons and thereby possess selective responsiveness for some characteristics and 
invariances for changes in other characteristics. This seems to have the 
potentiality of being a powerful information processing system.

3  Single units and psychophysics
The neurophysiological discoveries outlined above of course made a deep 
impression on those investigating sensation psychophysically, but although there 
are many superficial points of contact it has not proved easy to link sensations 
securely to specific patterns of neurophysiological activity. The topics I have 
chosen are again ones which seem to have implications about how we 
conceptualize this neuropsychic relationship.

3.1 Lateral inhibition and simultaneous contrast 
The relation between lateral inhibition in the retina and simultaneous contrast has 
already been mentioned, but there is a large gap between the physiological level 
and the subjective effects shown in textbook illustrations, and it is too big to be 
bridged by a single simple statement. It is quite easy to show that frog and cat 
retinal ganglion cells demonstrate relevant effects, since their antagonistic 
surrounds (Barlow, 1953; Kuffler 1953) make their responses depend upon 
contrast rather than absolute luminance. Hence on-centre cells respond to spots 
we would call white, off-centre cells to spots we would call black, even when the 
so-called black spot has a higher luminance than the white spot (Barlow et al., 
1957). But subjective contrast effects also hold for conditions where one cannot 
make such easy comparisons, for instance at the centre of an area which is much 
too large to fill the centre of a retinal receptive field. Of course, one can 
postulate some 'filling in' process (Yarbus, 1965), but the necessity of 
introducing ad hoc assumptions makes many explanations of subjective effects in 
terms of single units unconvincing.
The concept that enables one to escape this difficulty is to concentrate on the 
informational flow rather than on the direct subjective-physiological comparison. 
Information discarded in a peripheral stage of processing cannot be accurately 
added back centrally and in the present case it helps to talk about 'attenuating low 
spatial frequencies' instead of 'signalling spatial contrast'. To say that some of the 
lowfrequency attenuation of the whole visual system is performed by the opposed 
centre-surround organisation of the retinal ganglion cell (Campbell and Green, 
1965; Enroth-Cugell and Robson, 1966) is more accurate than to say that all 
simultaneous contrast effects originate there.

3.2 Colour 
In the field of colour vision De Valois has looked for relationships between 
various psychophysically measurable aspects of colour and the properties of 
single unit responses recorded at the level of the lateral geniculate nucleus. The 
main results provided a startling confirmation of Hering's long-standing 
hypothesis about the reciprocal organisation of colour systems (Svaetichin and 
MacNicholl, 1958; De Valois, 1960; Hurvich and Jameson, 1960; Wagner et al., 
1960), but the details are important. He has been able to establish neuro-psychic 
parallels using what may be called the 'lower envelope' or 'most sensitive neuron' 
principle. A monkey's ability to discriminate hue and saturation (De Valois et al., 
1966, 1967) is very close to what one would expect if the monkey only pays 
attention to the most sensitive of the optic nerves conveying information about 
these qualities of the stimulus. Thus the psychophysical performance follows the 
lower envelope of the performance of individual fibres. It is particularly 
interesting to see that a continuous psychophysical function, hue discrimination as 
a function of wavelength, is served by a different type of neuron in different 
ranges; over the long wavelength range the red-green opponent system was much 
more sensitive to wavelength shift, whereas the blue-yellow system was more 
sensitive at short wavelengths.
This result again fits in with the concept that neurophysiology and sensation 
are best linked by looking at the flow of information rather than simpler 
measures of neuronal activity. For instance it might be suggested that sensation 
follows the average neural activity, and it would be easy to justify this on the 
neurophysiological grounds that post-synaptic potentials are usually additive. 
However, this oversimple suggestion is proved false by the fact that 
psychophysical hue discrimination does not follow the average response of the 
red-green and blue-yellow systems, but instead follows the lower envelope. Now 
when two noisy channels are both conveying information about a signal, the 
channel with the highest signal/noise ratio dominates the situation; the low 
signal/noise ratio channel can be used to improve performance slightly, but it is a 
very small contribution except where its signal/noise ratio is nearly as high as that 
of the more sensitive channel. Thus the 'most-sensitive neuron' principle again 
fits the concept that, to link neurophysiological activity and sensation, one should 
look at the flow of information.

3.3 Touch 
Another example is given by the work of Mountcastle and his colleagues (Talbot 
et al., 1968), in which they studied the responses at a number of levels to 
vibratory stimuli applied to the glabrous skin of the hand. First they recorded 
from cutaneous afferents in the monkey, then the cortical responses in the same 
species, finally they made psychophysical measures of sensory responses in 
humans to the same stimuli. As with the work on colour, they established that the 
sensory response depends simply upon the category of nerve fibre with the lowest 
threshold.
The tact that the subjective sensation in both the colour and touch systems 
seems to follow the lower envelope of the responses of the various types of 
sensory neuron may give an important clue to the way in which these neurons 
represent sensations. It is as if the screen on which sensations appear is 
completely blank until a sensory pathway is activated, but when this happens a 
point lights up and becomes instantly visible. This is not what one would expect if 
there was a lot of ongoing activity in all pathways, or if the magnitude of the 
signal was a linear function of intensity, nor is it what one would expect if 
sensation depended in a complex combinatorial way upon the activity of many 
units. Rather it suggest the concept that the magnitude of the signal directly 
represents the signal/noise ratio, for then the insignificant signals will 
automatically be small, and the neuron firing most will automatically be the most 
sensitive. This concept receives some support in the next section and is taken up 
in the fifth dogma and its discussion.

3.4 Adaptation after-effects 
The fact that one is almost unaware of the constant pressure applied to the skin 
by the chair one is sitting on presumably results, at least in part, from the rapid 
decline in frequency of the volley of sensory impulses initiated by contact 
(Adrian, 19a8). Central neurons that respond to specific patterns of sensory input 
also give a decreased response when the pattern is sustained or repeatedly 
presented, though there have actually been surprisingly few investigations of this 
effect. These adaptation, habituation, or fatigue effects lead to plausible 
explanations for many well-known sensory illusions.
For example the rate of discharge in the directionally selective neurons of the 
rabbit retina declines if a stimulus is continuously moved through the receptive 
field in the preferred direction, and following cessation of movement the 
maintained discharge is found to be suppressed (Barlow and Hill, 1963). The 
resulting imbalance between neurons signalling opposite directions seems to 
provide a ready explanation of the apparent reversed movement of stationary 
objects following prolonged inspection of moving objects (the so-called 'waterfall 
effect'), and provides another example of an ancient psychophysical hypothesis 
(Wohlgemuth, 1911) being confirmed neurophysiologically. One must bear in 
mind that these neural effects were described in the rabbit's retina, whereas in the 
human, as in the cat and monkey, neurons are probably not directionally selective 
until the level of the visual cortex (Barlow and Brindley, 1963), but the same 
type of explanation may well apply to neurons at this level.
It has been suggested that one can make inverse inferences from the existence 
of an after-effect to the presence of neurons with particular selective responses. 
This is no place to argue whether the after-effects of adaptation to gratings imply 
a Fourier-type analysis (Blakemore and Campbell, 1969), or whether they can be 
satisfactorily accounted for by families of different-sized neurons with 
conventional Hubel-Wiesel-type receptive fields, but there is certainly room for 
argument, and this makes selective adaptation a difficult tool to use to discover 
later stages of information processing.
Instead, I think the importance of sensory adaptational effects, and of the 
corresponding neurophysiological phenomena, lies in the support both these 
phenomena lend to the concept put forward at the end of the last section. If 
sensory messages are to be given a prominence proportional to their 
informational value, mechanisms must exist for reducing the magnitude of 
representation of patterns which are constantly present, and this is presumably the 
underlying rationale for adaptive effects.

3.5 Noisiness or reliability of single units 
It used to be commonly held that nerve cells were unreliable elements, much 
perturbed by metabolic or other changes and perhaps also by random 
disturbances of more fundamental origin (McCulloch, 1959; Burns, 1968). The 
fairly high degree of reliability that the nervous system achieves as a whole was 
explained by the supposed redundancy of neural circuits and appropriate rules for 
averaging and combining them. Developments in the study of human vision at the 
absolute threshold and of the absolute sensitivity of retinal ganglion cells in the 
cat now indicate that nerve cells are not intrinsically unreliable and that noise 
often originates externally.
Signal detection theory has familiarized psychologists with the problem of 
detecting signals in the presence of noise (Tanner and Swets, 1954; Green and 
Swets, 1966), and I think the assumed prevalence of internally generated noise 
was a major reason why this was thought to be an important new approach. But 
psychophysical studies have actually shown that the senses and the brain can 
operate with astonishing intrinsic reliability. Noise may always be present, but to 
an amazing extent it originates outside the nervous system. This was originally 
implied by the results of Hecht et al. (1942) on the absolute threshold of vision; 
they showed that about 100 quanta at the cornea, leading to 10 or less absorptions 
in the retina, were sufficient to give a sensation of light. But their most 
revolutionary finding was that the frequency-of-seeing curve, describing the 
breadth of the threshold zone, is mainly accounted for by quantum fluctuations, 
not internal sloppiness or random variations of the threshold criterion as had 
previously been thought. That is not to say that Œintrinsic retinal noise' or 'dark 
light' is non-existent or unimportant, for it is probably the main factor 
determining how many quanta are required for reliable detection (Barlow, 1956). 
It now appears probable that this originates in the photoreceptors and, in some 
subjects at least, is low enough to allow the conscious detection of the sensation 
caused by absorption of a single quantum (Sakitt, 1972); similar sensations occur 
in the absence of light stimuli, but at a lower frequency. In addition, the subjects 
can apparently discriminate between the sensory messages resulting from 2, 3, 4, 
etc. quantal absorptions, each being detected progressively more clearly and 
reliably.
This psychophysical work shows that the human brain, acting as a whole, can 
distinguish between the disturbances caused by small numbers of quantal 
absorptions. These must of course originate from single molecular events in 
single cells, but possibly the disturbance is thereafter diffused through many cells 
and abstracted in some way from a redundant neural representation. It therefore 
becomes very interesting to go into the neurophysiology and find how the 
absorption of a few quanta is signalled.
A sensitive example of a retinal ganglion cell of the cat, with its associated 
bipolar cells, receptors, amacrine and horizontal cells, will give a readily 
detectable discharge of impulses to as few as 2 or 3 quanta of light absorbed in 
the retina (Barlow et al., 1 97 1). Such a stimulus will give rise to an average of 5 
to 1 0 extra impulses. Thus a single quantal absorption causes as many as 3 extra 
impulses, two quanta cause about 6 impulses, and so on. The addition of 3 
impulses to the maintained discharge is detectable on average, though, like the 
absorption of a single quantum in the human, it cannot be reliably detected on a 
single trial. There is of course some intrinsic noise, as shown by the maintained 
discharge, but its level is extraordinarily low when one considers that a single 
ganglion cell is connected to more than 100 rods containing a total of some 101 
molecules of rhodopsin, each poised ready to signal the absorption of a quantum. 
The important point is that quantitative knowledge of the noise level and 
reliability of single retinal ganglion cells enables one to see that the performance 
of the whole visual system can be attributed to a single cell: averaging is not 
necessary.
Individual nerve cells were formerly thought to be unreliable, idiosyncratic, 
and incapable of performing complex tasks without acting in concert and thus 
overcoming their individual errors. This was quite wrong, and we now realise 
their apparently erratic behaviour was caused by our ignorance, not the neuron's 
incompetence. Thus we gain support from this neuropsychical comparison for the 
concept of a neuron as a reliable element capable of performing a responsible 
role in our mental life, though we need not of course go to the other extreme and 
assume that mental errors are never caused by malfunctioning, ill-educated, or 
noisy neurons.

4  Modifiability of cortical neurons 
The most recent conceptual change about the neural basis of our sensations has 
arisen from a reinspection of the origin of the selective responsiveness of cortical 
neurons.

4.1 Evidence for modifiability 
Hubel and Wiesel (1963) at first thought they had shown that the whole of the 
elaborate organization responsible for the selectivity of neurons in the primary 
visual cortex was developed solely under genetic control. They reported that they 
found cortical neurons with normal adult-type specificity of responsiveness in 
young kittens which had not opened their eyes, or which had been deprived of 
visual experience by suture of their eyelids. In later investigations (Wiesel and 
Hubel, 1963, 1965; Hubel and Wiesel, 1965) they found that abnormal visual 
experience, such as unilateral eye-suture, or prevention of simultaneous usage of 
the eyes by alternating occlusion or surgically induced strabismus, caused the 
development of an abnormal population of cortical cells. In accordance with their 
earlier findings they attributed this to a disruption of the preformed organization, 
and they discovered the very important fact that abnormal experience only 
modifies the cortex if it occurs during a particular 'sensitive' periodabout 3 to 
12 weeks in cats (Hubel and Wiesel, 1970).
Recent developments have extended these seminal findings, but they lead to 
somewhat different conclusions about the relative importance of experience and 
genetic factors in determining the selectivity of cortical neurons. First it was 
shown that kittens brought up with the two eyes exposed to different stimuli, one 
to vertical stripes, the other to horizontal, had a corresponding orientation 
selectivity of the receptive fields connected to each eye (Hirsch and Spinelli, 
1970, 1971). This was confirmed in kittens exposed only to vertically or 
horizontally striped environments; these had no neurons sensitive to horizontally 
or vertically oriented stimuli respectively (Blakemore and Cooper, 1970). 
Evidence has been obtained that cats raised with a vertical displacement of the 
images in one eye induced by prisms also have abnormal vertical disparities of 
the pairs of receptive fields of cortical neurons connected to both eyes (Shlaer, 
1971). Again, the cortex of a kitten exposed only to bright dots, with no contours 
or edges, contained units of an abnormal type responding well to small spots of 
light and showing little of the customary preference for lines (Pettigrew and 
Freeman, forthcoming). Furthermore it appears that a very brief period of 
exposure, as little as an hour, can have very pronounced effects on the subsequent 
selectivity of neurons in the visual cortex (Blakemore and Mitchell, 1973).
Such results could still possibly have been explained by disruption of the 
innately-determined highly-specific connections that were originally thought to 
underlie response specificity, but a reexamination of the properties of cortical 
neurons of kittens with no visual experience shows that they do not actually have 
fully-developed adult-type specificity (Barlow and Pettigrew, 1971). This is 
certainly the case with regard to disparity selectivity and, although there is 
directional preference and may be some weak orientation selectivity, they are not 
as narrowly selective as adult cells (Pettigrew, forthcoming). The anatomy of the 
developing cortex shows that only a small fraction of the normal complement of 
synapses is present before the critical period, and it is hard to believe that the 
cells could have adult properties (Cragg, 1972). It will take more work to 
determine the limits within which the pattern selectivity of cortical neurons can 
be modified, but the results already make it impossible to believe Hubel and 
Wiesel's original claim that many cells of the visually inexperienced kitten have 
the full adult-type selectivity.

4.2 Type of modification caused 
It is instructive to look at the way in which experience modifies selectivity. In 
all cases the cortex of animals whose visual experience has been modified lacks 
neurons selectively responsive to patterns of excitation which a normal animal 
receives, but which have been excluded by the experimental modification. Thus 
unilateral lid suture led to a cortex with very few neurons excitable from the lid-
sutured eye; likewise, alternating occlusion or strabismus, which decreases the 
probability of simultaneous excitation of corresponding neurons in the two eyes, 
decreased the proportion of neurons responding to both eyes. The same is true of 
the kittens reared in striped environments, or with a vertically deviating prism 
over one eye, or in an environment with point sources but no lines; in all these 
cases the rule holds that neurons are found for patterns of excitation that occur in 
the modified environment, but normally occurring types of selectivity are rare or 
absent if the patterns they would respond to have not been experienced in the 
modified environment. This rule seems to amount to a striking confirmation of 
the speculation (Barlow, 1960) that a prime function of sensory centres is to code 
efficiently the patterns of excitation that occur, thus developing a less redundant 
representation of the environment. Previous examples of redundancy-reducing 
codes could be explained as genetically determined features of neural 
connectivity, but the above discoveries are definite examples of a modified code 
developed in response to a modified environment .
If on this page we have begun the correct story for simple cells of area 17, 
one can see that a book has been opened with regard to the properties of cells 
higher in the hierarchy. which are presumably themselves experience dependent 
and are fed by information from these experience-dependent neurons at the lower 
cortical levels. Even a small degree of modifiability would be extraordinarily 
significant in a hierarchically organized system, just as, in evolution, weak 
selection pressure is effective over many generations.

5  Current concept of the single neuron 
The cumulative effect of all the changes I have tried to outline above has been to 
make us realise that each single neuron can perform a much more complex and 
subtle task than had previously been thought. Neurons do not loosely and 
unreliably map the luminous intensities of the visual image onto our sensorium, 
but instead they detect pattern elements, discriminate the depth of objects, ignore 
irrelevant causes of variation, and are arranged in an intriguing hierarchy. 
Furthermore, there is evidence that they give prominence to what is 
informationally important, can respond with great reliability, and can have their 
pattern selectivity permanently modified by early visual experience. This amounts 
to a revolution in our outlook. It is now quite inappropriate to regard unit 
activity as a noisy indication of more basic and reliable processes involved in 
mental operations; instead, we must regard single neurons as the prime movers of 
these mechanisms. Thinking is brought about by neurons, and we should not use 
phrases like 'Unit activity reflects, reveals, or monitors thought processes', 
because the activities of neurons, quite simply, are thought processes.
This revolution stemmed from physiological work and makes us realise that 
the activity of each single neuron may play a significant role in perception. I 
think that more clearly stated hypotheses are now needed about these roles in 
order to allow our psychological knowledge and intuitions about our perceptions 
to help us plan future experiments.

6 Five propositions 
The following five brief statements are intended to define which aspect of the 
brain's activity is important for understanding its main function, to suggest the 
way that single neurons represent what is going on around us, and to say how this 
is related to our subjective experience. The statements are dogmatic and 
incautious because it is important that they should be clear and testable.

6.1 First dogma 
A description of that activity of a single nerve cell which is transmitted to and 
influences other nerve cells, and of a nerve cell's response to such influences 
from other cells, is a complete enough description for functional understanding 
of the nervous system. There is nothing else 'looking at' or controlling this 
activity, which must therefore provide a basis for understanding how the brain 
controls behaviour.

6.2 Second dogma
At progressively higher levels in sensory pathways information about the 
physical stimulus is carried by progressively fewer active neurons. The sensory 
system is organized to achieve as complete a representation as possible with the 
minimum number of active neurons.

6.3 Third dogma 
Trigger features of neurons are matched to the redundant features of sensory 
stimulation in order to achieve greater completeness and economy of 
representation. This selective responsiveness is determined by the sensory 
stimulation to which neurons have been exposed, as well as by genetic factors 
operating during development .

6.4  Fourth dogma 
Just as physical stimuli directly cause receptors to initiate neural activity, so the 
active high-level neurons directly and simply cause the elements of our 
perception.

6.5  Fifth dogma 
The frequency of neural impulses codes subjective certainty: a high impulse 
frequency in a given neuron corresponds to a high degree of confidence that the 
cause of the percept is present in the external world.

7 First dogma: Significant level of description 
This dogma asserts that a picture of how the brain works, and in particular how it 
processes and represents sensory information, can be built up from knowledge of 
the interactions of individual cells. At the moment single-unit electrical recording 
is the only tool with temporal and spatial resolution adequate to locate the effect 
of a particular sensory stimulus in a particular cell. Other tools (biochemical, 
electron microscopy, etc.) can obviously provide essential information about 
these interactions, but the dogma may be criticized more fundamentally; it may 
be suggested that the whole problem should be approached at a different level. 
One could attack from either side, suggesting either that one should look at 
grosser signs of nervous activity, such as the weak extracellular potentials that 
result from the activity of many neurons, or that one should approach the 
problem at a more microscopic level, studying synaptic and molecular changes.
Interest in evoked potentials and electroencephalography has waned partly 
because their study led to slow progress compared with single-unit recording, but 
also because the rationale for their use was undermined. A prime reason for 
attending to these macroscopic manifestations of nervous activity was the belief 
that individual cells were too unreliable to be worthy of attention singly, and 
hence it was better to look at a sign of activity that resulted from many of them. 
Here, it was thought, may be a property of a group of cells analogous to 
temperature or pressure as a property of a collection of molecules that 
individually behave randomly. The demonstration that single nerve cells have 
diverse and highly specific responsiveness to sensory stimuli, and are 
astonishingly reliable, showed the fallacy of this analogy.
The search for a molar property of a mass of working nerve cells is certainly 
not worthless. Physiologists, and all biologists for that matter, tend to be 
emotionally divided into globalists and atomists. The globalists are amazed at the 
perfection of functioning of the whole animal, and they observe that the atomists' 
analytical investigations of living matter always leave unexplained many of the 
most remarkable attributes of the intact animal. As a result the globalist can play 
a crucially important role in pointing out where the atomists' explanations are 
incomplete. Now the brain does much more interesting things than produce weak 
extracellular potentials: it controls behaviour, and this is surely the global 
product that, at our present state of understanding, really does appear greater 
than the sum of its parts. It would be no use looking at single neurons if it will be 
forever impossible to explain overall behaviour in terms of the actions and 
interactions of these subunits; if that were so, the globalists' despair would be 
justified. On the other hand it is precisely because rapid progress has been made 
that this article is being written; it no longer seems completely unrealistic to 
attempt to understand perception at the atomic single-unit level.
The second criticism, that one should approach the problem at a more 
microscopic level, is really only answerable by saying, "Go ahead and do it", for 
undoubtedly there is much to be learned at a synaptic and molecular level. But the 
important question here is whether lack of this knowledge will impede a major 
advance in our conception of how the brain works. The dogma asserts that it is 
the intercellular actions and interactions that possess the elaborate organization 
responsible for behaviour; hence it asserts that knowledge at a more-microscopic 
intracellular level is not a prerequisite for understanding such organization.

8  Second dogma: The economical representation of sensory messages 
The main task in this section is to discern the principles that underlie the changes 
in characteristic responsiveness of single units at successive levels in sensory 
pathways. The aim is to understand how sensory information is represented or 
'displayed'. The successive levels to be considered will be peripheral 
photoreceptors and cutaneous afferents; retinal ganglion cells of the cat, frog, or 
rabbit, the latter of which seem to exemplify a more complex type of processing; 
and the visual cortex of cats. Obviously these are not an ideal series for 
comparisons and extrapolations, but they are the best we can do.
The discussion initially revolves around three issues: changes in the degree of 
specificity and generality of the stimuli to which the cells respond; changes in the 
number of parallel categories of selectively sensitive cells that carry the 
information; and changes in the number of the cells that one may expect to be 
activated by normal visual scenes. What emerges is that, at the higher levels, 
fewer and fewer cells are active, but each represents a more and more specific 
happening in the sensory environment .

8.1 Specificity and generality of responsiveness 
The pattern specificity of sensory neurons is the aspect that is most widely 
emphasized: it was spectacular to discover single neurons in the retina responding 
to movement of the image in a specific direction, cortical neurons responding 
only to slits of light at a particular orientation, and a unit in the infero-temporal 
cortex that responds best to a monkey's hand. But the invariance of the response 
to changes in the stimulus is equally remarkable. A retinal unit continues to 
respond to direction of motion in spite of many decades of change in input 
luminance or contrast, in fact in spite of reversal of contrast (Barlow, 1969a). At 
the cortical level a complex cell insists that a stimulus is appropriately oriented, 
but will respond in spite of wide variations of position (Hubel and Wiesel, 1962). 
And the monkey-paw unit similarly retains its pattern specificity over a large part 
of the visual field (Gross et al., 1972).
In talking about these properties of sensory neurons actual examples are 
perhaps more informative than the words specific and general. A single receptor 
containing a red-sensitive pigment is specific in the sense that long-wavelength 
light must be present at a particular part of the image in order to excite it, and it 
is general in the sense that all images with this property will excite it. In contrast 
to this type of specificity and generality, the high-level neurons are no longer 
limited to purely local attributes of the image. They are selective for pattern, 
which requires that a considerable region of the image is taken into account. But 
there are other aspects of their specific selectivity that also need to be considered.

8.2  Number of selective categories 
At the level of receptors there are a small number of different sensory modalities 
picking up. in parallel, information from different positions. This is the case both 
for the half dozen types of cutaneous sensation, and for the smaller number of 
retinal receptor types responding to the visual image. At the level of ganglion 
cells the number of sub-modalities or selective categories has greatly increased. 
Consider the rabbit, where there are the following (Barlow et al., 1964; Levick, 
1967): two concentric types (on- and off-centre); four on-off type directionally 
selective (for movements up, down, antero-posterior, and postero-anterior); three 
directions for slow, on-type, directionally selective; one type sensitive to fast 
movement; one type sensitive to 'uniformity'; and, confined to the visual streak, 
two types of orientation-selective neurons, neurons selective for slow-moving 
small objects, and neurons selective for edges. This makes a total of 15 different 
selective categories. In addition there must be units signalling colour, since the 
rabbit shows behavioural evidence for it, but these have not yet been found in the 
retina.
Now move up to the simple cells in area 17 of cat cortex. These vary in 
position, orientation, disparity, and size, as well as being selective for light bars, 
dark bars, or edges. The evidence is not sufficient to say how many distinct 
selective categories these form. but for each of the first three variables the 
resolution of a single neuron is good, in the sense that small departures from the 
preferred position, orientation, or disparity cause large decreases of response 
amplitude (Bishop, 1970). These variables already define four dimensions, and 
we have not yet considered size specificity. velocity specificity, nor the additional 
complexities of light, dark, or edge detectors. and of course colour. There are 
certainly several orders of magnitude more neurons in the primary projection 
area than there are input fibres, or resolvable points in the visual field, and it is 
abundantly clear that the number of selective categories has increased 
enormously. Activity of a particular neuron signifies much more than the 
presence of light at a particular locus in the visual field; its activity signifies a 
great deal about the nature of the pattern of light at that locus.
The fact that many parallel communication channels are used in the nervous 
system has been widely recognized, but here we see an enormous expansion of the 
number of parallel paths, and this occurs without much redundant reduplication 
of channels, for each neuron seems to have a different specific responsiveness. It 
is as if, at high levels, the size of the alphabet available for representing a sensory 
message was enormously increased. Perhaps it would be better to say that, if the 
activity of a low-level neuron is like the occurrence of a letter, that of a high-
level neuron is like the occurrence of a worda meaningful combination of 
letters. But to understand this better we must look at the third aspect of the way 
sensory messages are represented at different levels, namely the proportion of 
neurons that are usually active. If the pattern of activity caused by a visual scene 
has, on average, K neurons active out of the total of N neurons, then we have 
seen above that a increases at high levels; call one say anything about how K 
changes'?

8.3  Number of active cells 
If one considers the retinal cones under typical photopic conditions, the vast 
majority must be partially active. They may be nearer the depolarized than the 
hyperpolarized limit of their dynamic range, but the majority will be somewhere 
well within it. For the retinal ganglion cells of a cat the situation is a little 
different; while a few units, those corresponding to the brightest and dimmest 
parts of the scene, will be vigorously active, the majority, corresponding to the 
parts of the scene near the mean luminance. will be discharging at rates close to 
their maintained discharge level, which in its turn is near the low-frequency end 
of their dynamic range. Thus there will be a lot of units with low degrees of 
activity and a few which are vigorously active. Recoding in the retina changes the 
distribution of activity so that low impulse frequencies are common, high impulse 
frequencies rare.
Now consider the rabbit, with its more elaborate retinal processing, and 
greater richness of pattern-feature signalling neurons. It is characteristic of the 
more specific of these neurons that they have a very low maintained discharge, 
and are extremely hard to excite until their exact trigger feature has been found. 
One flashes lights waves wands, and jiggles 'noise figures' in the appropriate part 
of the visual field for many minutes, maybe hours, before finding the right 
combination for excitation. It is reasonably certain that the right combination 
does not occur often in the natural environment either, and therefore these units 
must spend only a small fraction of the time in an active state. Low impulse 
frequencies are even commoner, high impulse frequencies even rarer, than in cat 
retina.
For the cat cortex this trend is carried further, and one can see another aspect 
emerging. If one takes a small region of the visual field, it either does contain a 
bright bar, dark bar, or edge, or, much more likely, it does not. Thus, like the 
rabbit units, the cells with these specific responsivities must be only infrequently 
active. But in addition, on the rare occasions when one of the appropriate trigger 
features is present, it is one of a set which tend to be mutually exclusive: a bright 
bar cannot be a dark bar, and it can have only one orientation and disparity. The 
stimulus selects which cell to activate from a range of many possible cells, and it 
is pretty well impossible to activate simultaneously more than a small fraction of 
this number.
The picture developing is that at low levels visual information is carried by 
the pattern of joint activity of many elements, whereas at the upper levels of the 
hierarchy a relatively small proportion are active, and each of these says a lot 
when it is active. But, although we clearly see that the proportion active, K/N, 
decreases, we cannot tell whether it decreases as rapidly as N increases, and thus 
we still do not know how K itself changes. The second dogma goes beyond the 
evidence, but it attempts to make sense out of it. It asserts that the overall 
direction or aim of information processing in higher sensory centres is to 
represent the input as completely as possible by activity in as few neurons as 
possible (Barlow, 1961, 1969b). In other words, not only the proportion but also 
the actual number of active neurons, K, is reduced, while as much information as 
possible about the input is preserved.
By now much can one reasonably expect K to be reduced? One requires the 
concepts of channel capacity and redundancy from information theory (Shannon 
and Weaver, 1949; Woodward, 1953) to make a rough estimate. Some reduction 
can be accomplished without any loss of information simply by the increase of N. 
K/N is the probability of a fibre being active, and, if it is the same for all 
neurons, the information capacity of a set of N neurons, either active or not 
active, is -Klog2(K/N)- (N- K)log2[(N- K)/N]. If K/N is small, the second term 
contributes little; the capacity then is, approximately, the number of active 
neurons times the information provided by each active neuron, and this increases 
directly as the negative logarithm of the probability of it being active, -log(K/N). 
Hence the number active can be reduced as N increases without loss of 
information capacity, but by itself this does not allow K to be reduced very much: 
for instance, if we suppose that a of the 2 x 106 optic nerve fibres are active and 
that there are 108 cortical neurons receiving this information, then one finds that 
1 5 x 105 cortical neurons must, on average, be active in order to have the same 
information capacity as the 5 x 105 active optic nerve fibres. But this applies only 
to capacity, and a substantial reduction in K is possible on the basis of another 
principle.
Visual information is enormously redundant, and it has been suggested 
previously that sensory coding is largely concerned with exploiting this 
redundancy to obtain more economical representation of the information. If the 
argument is correct, the number of active neurons can be reduced, but it is very 
difficult even to guess how big a reduction in K such recoding can achieve; if it is 
a up to the cortex, and another factor of m achieved in visual I, II and III, one 
would end up with about 1000 active fibres carrying the information provided by 
5 x 105 active optic nerve fibres; though the reductions might be substantially 
greater or less, this is the order of magnitude of the reduction contemplated.
According to dogma, these 1000 active neurons represent the visual scene, but 
it is obvious that each neuron must convey an enormously larger share of the 
picture than, say, one point out of the quarter million points of a television 
picture. Perhaps a better analogy is to recall the 1000 words that a picture is 
proverbially worth; apparently an active neuron says something of the order of 
complexity of a word. It seems to me not unreasonable to suppose that a single 
visual scene can be represented quite completely by about 1000 of such entities, 
bearing in mind that each one is selected from a vast vocabulary and will in 
addition carry some positional information.

9 Third dogma: Selectivity adapted to environment
9.1 Evolutionary adaptation
Some economies of the type indicated above can be achieved by exploiting forms 
of redundancy which are present in all normal environments. Levels of sensory 
stimulation do not range at random over the whole scale of possible values, and it 
makes sense to regard adaptation of peripheral receptors as a measure to achieve 
economy by signalling changes from tae mean instead of absolute values. 
Similarly in most situations neighbouring points on a sensory surface are more 
likely to be similar than distant points, and it thus makes sense to regard contrast 
enhancement by lateral inhibition as another economy measure. The argument 
can be carried on to cover the redundancy-reducing value of movement, edge, or 
disparity detectors (Barlow, 1969b), but, if these are genetically-determined 
redundancy-reducing codes, they must be fixed once and for all during 
development, and they could only work for redundant properties of all sensory 
environments. The hypothesis becomes more interesting when one considers the 
possible mechanisms for achieving economy by exploiting the redundancy of 
particular sensory scenes, for this requires storage of information and plasticity 
of the neural structures involved.

9.2 Reversible adaptation 
The neural changes of dark and light adaptation may be regarded as a simple 
example of reversible plasticity achieving this end. The luminance corresponding 
to zero impulses is affected by the past history of illumination and by the 
surrounding luminances in such a way that the majority of fibres are responding 
at low frequencies. But, even though this involves definite changes in the synaptic 
transfer properties of retinal neurons, the statistical characteristic of visual 
images that enables this to achieve economy is always the same, namely the fact 
that the distribution of luminances is grouped around local and temporal mean 
values, so that small deviations from the mean are commoner than large 
deviations (Barlow, 1969a). Hence the most commonly occurring luminances 
require fewest impulses.

9.3 Permanent adaptation 
The effects permanently impressed on the visual system during the sensitive 
period are the first example of plasticity for a particular type of redundancy. The 
distribution of orientational selectivity of primary neurons is biased in favour of 
the orientations the individual experienced during this critical time. If the analogy 
of a neuron's signal resembling the utterance of a word is recalled, this result 
suggests that the kitten's cortex only develops words for what it has seen. This 
could be brought about by either selection or modification: are the dictionary 
words there, only the ones experienced becoming permanently connected; or do 
the cells themselves determine that a frequently experienced pattern, such as lines 
of a particular range of orientation, are events for which words are desirable? 
The evidence favours modification, and the idea to which it leads of the 
successive hierarchical construction of a dictionary of meaningful neurons has 
enormous appeal. For the present we can only justify the third dogma by saying 
the evidence suggests such a dictionary may be built up, though we are far from 
being able to look into its pages by physiological methods. In the next section we 
turn to the subjective view of this dictionary.

10  Fourth dogma: Origin of perceptions
10.1 Personal perception 
In order to delimit more accurately what this dogma does and does not say it may 
be useful to define and separate three mysteries of perception. The first is the 
personal, subjective, aspect of my experience of, say, the red pencil with a blue 
eraser in my hand. There does not seem to be anything that could be said about 
the activity of nerve cells accompanying this experience that would in any way 
'explain' the aspect of it that is mysterious, personal, and subjective. I think this 
part of the experience is something that one must be content to leave on one side 
for the moment but it is important that this part of subjective experience almost 
always accompanies electrical stimulation of a peripheral sensory nerve, and 
usually accompanies electrical stimulation of the sensory areas of the brain, for 
this implies that the full subjective experience, including this mysterious personal 
element, accompanies the neural events of sensation, however these are caused. 
This fact strongly suggests that it is no waste of time to look into these neural 
events: beauty is a mysterious attribute of a work of art, but that does not imply 
that you cannot create a beautiful painting by non-mysterious material means.

10.2  Conscious perception
The second mystery is that we are not consciously aware of much that goes on in 
our brains, so the inverse of the fourth dogma is certainly not true: not every 
cortical neuron's activity has a simple perceptual correlate. Even at high mental 
levels much neural business is conducted without conscious awareness, and my 
own belief is that the conscious part is confined to experiences one communicates 
to other people, or experiences one is contemplating communicating to other 
people. This immediately introduces a social element into individual 
consciousness, for communication is impossible without a channel being open to a 
recipient. However, for present purposes we need only point out that interesting 
aspects of consciousness of this sort are by no means incompatible with the fourth 
dogma. An element of perception can possess a simple neural cause without it 
necessarily being the case that all simple neural events cause perception. There is 
therefore plenty of room for social, historical, or moral influences on perception, 
because these can influence the selection of the neural events that alter conscious 
perception.

10.3Validity of perceptions
The third mystery about perceptions is why they are generally 'true': why are 
they so extraordinarily useful in guiding our actions and helping us to make 
decisions? This is the aspect that the second and third dogmas help one to 
understand. The economical and fairly complete representation of visual scenes 
by a reasonably small number of active neurons makes it much easier to visualize 
how they can be used for these purposes. The key point is that the active neurons 
carry the bulk of the information, and the vast number of inactive ones need not 
be taken into consideration. The difficulty of detecting among our sense 
impressions the entities we use for rational thought has always been baffling: 
'water', 'men', 'sheep', and even the simple letter 'A' represent particular logical 
functions of activity among the sensory neurons, but the number of possible 
logical functions is so vast that we are mystified how particular ones are realized, 
or why particular ones are selected for realization. The representation suggested 
by the second and third dogmas would allow relatively simple logical 
combinations to have properties approaching those required for the literal 
symbols of Boole (1854), the subjects of our conceptions. By using such symbols 
together with operational signs he founded mathematical logic, but the title of his 
major work, "The Laws of Thought", clearly states his claim that his inquiries 
had "probable intimations concerning the nature and constitution of the human 
mind". It is gratifying to approach closer to an intuitively plausible neural 
realization of what he symbolized.
The notion that what we sense is a point by point representation of the physical 
signals impinging on our body has been rejected for psychological and 
philosophical reasons (see Boring, 194a), and more recent physiological evidence 
clearly supports this rejection. But this same evidence suggests that it should be 
replaced, not by return to a subjectively constructed phenomenology (Dreyfus, 
1972), nor by the notion that we sense the world in terms of rigidly preordained 
'structures', but by the deeper and more adaptive ideas of dogmas two and three; 
our sensorium is presented with a fairly small number of communications, each 
representing the occurrence of a group of external events having a word-like 
order of complexity, and, like words, having the special property that they lead 
to an economical representation of these physical events.

11  Fifth dogma: Signalling subjective certainty
There is one way in which the properties of neurons do not match up to the way 
Boole used symbols, for he insisted on their binary nature, or 'duality'. This is 
the property Aristotle called the principle of contradiction, and without it Boole's 
symbolic representation of logic would have been impossible. In contrast to this 
duality the response of a sensory nerve cell to its trigger feature consists of a 
volley of impulses lasting T5 to I second, during which time the neuron can 
discharge any number of impulses between zero and nearly 1000. Therefore the 
response is graded, and it is not legitimate to consider it as a Boolean binary 
variable. The essential notion expressed in the fifth dogma is that a neuron stands 
for an idealization of reality whose complement can be formulated as a null 
hypothesis, and it is this that has the required Boolean logical property of duality. 
The idealizations should not be thought of as Kantian or Platonic, but rather as 
abstractions that model reality in the manner suggested by Craik (1943). The 
ideal populations of a statistician come even closer, for the parameters of such 
distributions model reality, and they are used to calculate whether or not a 
particular sample belongs within it. The process of idealizing the complement of 
the trigger feature will be clarified by a simple example.
Suppose we have a sensory neuron whose trigger feature is a simple physical 
event, such as the increase of light intensity at a specific position in the visual 
field. We are examining the suggestion that the graded responses this neuron 
gives to visual stimuli represent some function of the degree of certainty that the 
light did in fact increase estimated from the physical events accessible to the 
neuron. For simplicity assume that a record is available of the total numbers of 
quanta absorbed in the receptive field of the sensory neuron during successive 
periods of about a second duration up to and including the period about which it 
is to signal centrally. It is in principle possible to calculate the probability of 
occurrence of the observed number of quantal absorptions on the hypothesis that 
there was no change in the light intensity, and this is the test a statistician would 
apply to determine whether or not the trigger feature was present. On this view 
impulse frequency signals some function of the significance level of a test of this 
sort, low probabilities corresponding to high impulse frequencies. Notice that the 
trigger feature is 'an increase of light', the idealization is 'there was no increase', 
and this idealization is based on observation of what has recently happened and 
therefore incorporates a model of the recent past.
The responses actually obtained to varying intensities of incremental stimulus 
fit quite well into this scheme (Barlow, 1969a), as do some less obvious features. 
The low-frequency maintained discharge could well represent the results, of low 
significance, obtained by testing the null hypothesis when no stimulus has been 
applied. Although individual fibres would not reach significance, information 
about quantal absorptions would be retained, and changes insignificant singly 
could be combined centrally to reach significance.
In the above example a high value of P and low impulse frequency would 
result from a shadow falling on the receptive field. The detection of this shadow 
might be of great survival significance for the animal, but the on-centre unit's 
trigger feature, null hypothesis, and statistical tests would be a poor way of 
detecting and signalling this important event. A different type of unit is required 
whose null hypothesis should be "There has been no decrease in the quantal 
absorption rate"; these would fire when the hypothesis is disproved by the quantal 
absorption rate dropping below the normal range of variation. Obviously these 
are the off-centre units, and it seems that the existence of complementary 'on' and 
'off' systems fits the notion quite well. When there are a large number of neurons 
with trigger features that cannot coexist, as in area 17, these correspond to a 
large number of mutually exclusive hypotheses to be tested.
The fifth dogma clearly requires more development and testing, but it 
provides a possible answer to the question "What variable corresponds to impulse 
frequency in a high level sensory neuron?" Furthermore the answer ties it to a 
rather definitely felt subjective quantity -- the sense of certainty.

12  Criticisms and alternatives
Single-unit recording hints at this probabilistic, adaptive, many-levelled, system 
for processing and displaying sellsorv information, but can we believe that what 
we perceive is the activity of a relatively small selection of upper-level units of 
this hierarchy? This is certainly a big jump beyond the present physiological 
evidence. We do not know how perspective transformations are disregarded, 
enabling us to perceive the same object irrespective of our angle of view, nor do 
we understand the mechanisms underlying size constancy. Yet these mechanisms 
must intervene between the highest neurons we know about and quite simple 
perceptions. I think we have seen enough of what can be achieved in a few stages 
of neural image processing to believe that a few more stages could reach the point 
where a single neuron embodies, by virtue of its peripheral connections and their 
properties, an elementary percept, but let us examine an alternative and the 
evidence adduced in its support.

12.1  Combinatorial or holographic representations
The key suggestion about the organization of sensory processing that the 
second dogma asserts is that the information is carried by progressively fewer 
active neurons at progressively higher levels in the hierarchy. The brain receives 
complex patterns of activity in nerve fibres from the sensory receptors, and it 
generates complex patterns of outgoing commands to the muscles. It could be 
held that the patterns are equally complex at all the intervening stages as well, and 
this would mean that the significance of a single unit¹s activity would be virtually 
undecipherable without knowing what was going on in a host of other units. 
Certainly one would make little progress in understanding a computer's operation 
by following the status of a single bit in its central processor, so this criticism is 
partly met by pointing to the success that has been achieved in the visual system 
by looking at the activity of units singly, one at a time. But we should also look 
critically at the main evidence advanced in favour of the combinatorial or 
holographic scheme.

12.2 Mass action and resistance to damage 
The main argument that has been levelled against the view that individual cells 
play an important role in perception and in favour of a holographic 
representation is the reported fact that large parts of the cortex can be damaged 
with only minor resultant changes in behaviour or learning (Lashley, 1929, 
1950). This led to Lashley's doctrine of 'cerebral mass action', but repetition of 
the original experiments and refinements in methods of testing, some of it by 
Lashley himself, have considerably weakened the original evidence in its favour 
(Zangwill, 1961). However, it certainly is remarkable that a mechanism with as 
much interdependence between its parts as the brain can function at all after it has 
been extensively damaged. A computer would not usually survive brain surgery 
or gunshot wounds, and it is therefore worthwhile considering the implications of 
the fact that the cortex is relatively immune to quite extensive injury.
The whole of a visual scene can be reconstructed from a small part of a 
hologram, with only slight loss of resolution and degradation of signal/noise ratio 
(Gabor et al., 1971), so it has been claimed that the cortex must operate by some 
analogous principle in order to account for its resistance to damage. What is not 
widely appreciated is the fact that holography differs from ordinary image-
recording photography not only in principle, but also in the materials used, for it 
requires photographic emulsions with resolutions of the order of the wavelength 
of light (Gabor et al. 1971). With such materials a good quality 35 mm picture 
could easily be reproduced and repeated in every 1 mm2 of the plate, and a plate 
containing such a reduplicated image would have to be pulverized into tiny pieces 
to prevent reconstructibility of the original from every fragment. The mass-
action-like resistance to damage of the hologram is partly due to the enormous 
informational capacity of the materials that are required; immunity to damage is 
easy to achieve when such high redundancy is permissible, and this argument 
carries little weight in favour of holographic views of nervous operation.
Codes can be given error-correcting properties much less wastefully, and the 
argument call be turned around to favour the representation hypothesized in 
dogmas two and three. Because the few active cells have a fixed significance, and 
because the inactive ones are thought to carry so little information that they can 
be neglected, the only result of removing part of the cortex would be to eliminate 
some of the active neurons, and hence some of the perceptual entities, when a 
given scene is viewed. The 'meaning' of the active units in the undamaged cortex 
would remain the same, and might provide a sufficient basis for decision and 
action. This is very different from the situation where a neuron's activity has 
totally different significance depending upon the pattern of activity of which it 
forms a part, for if any of this pattern was in a damaged region the significance 
of activity in the undamaged part would be altered. Hence damage immunity is 
really an argument for neurons having an invariant meaning not dependent upon 
the activity of other neurons.
It should also be pointed out that very limited replication of 'percept neurons' 
would give considerable damage immunity: if a given neuron is replicated half a 
dozen times in different cortical regions there is a good chance of at least one of 
them surviving an extensive cortical ablation. This sixfold redundancy is 
enormously less than the holographic scheme possesses, and it can be concluded 
that the mass action argument rebounds against the extensive combinatorial usage 
of neurons and actually favours the hypothesis of this article.

12.3  Pontifical cells
Sherrington (1941) introduced the notion of "one ultimate pontifical nerve-cell, 
... the climax of the whole system of integration?and immediately rejected the 
idea in favour of the concept of mind as a "million-fold democracy whose each 
unit is a cell". Those who like the notion of perception as a cooperative or 
emergent property of many cells dismiss the suggestion that the activity of a 
single neuron can be an important element of perception by saying that, carried 
to its logical conclusion, it implies there must be a single 'pontifical cell' 
corresponding to each and every recognizable object or scene. First notice that 
the current proposal does not say that each distinct perception corresponds to a 
different neuron being active, if perception is taken to mean the whole of what is 
perceived at any one moment; it says there is a simple correspondence between 
the elements of perception and unit activity. Thus the whole of subjective 
experience at any one time must correspond to a specific combination of active 
cells, and the 'pontifical cell' should be replaced by a number of 'cardinal cells'. 
Among the many cardinals only a few speak at once; each makes a complicated 
statement, but not, of course, as complicated as that of the pontif if he were to 
express the whole of perception in one utterance.
Two important difficulties arise from the notion of pontifical cells; first, if a 
separate neuron is needed for each of our perceptions there are not enough to 
account for their almost incredible variety; second, the activity of a single 
isolated element would not convey anything of a perception's great richness. the 
connection between one perception and others. The 'grandmother cell' might 
respond to all views of grandmother's face, but how would that indicate that it 
shares features in common with other human faces, and that, on a particular 
occasion, it occurs in a specific position surrounded by other recognizable 
objects? Our perceptions simply do not have the property of being isolated unique 
events as one would expect if each corresponded to the firing of a unique neuron. 
Instead, they overlap with each other, sharing parts which continue unchanged 
from one moment to another, or recur at later moments in different contexts. I 
think the 'cardinal cell' representation surmounts these problems without any 
difficulty; if a critic can say how many different perceptions we are capable of, 
and how rich a network of relatedness exists between these perceptions, then one 
might be able to estimate how many cardinals' voices were required to represent 
these perceptions. But there is a misleading feature of the ecclesiastical analogy.
Most organizational hierarchies are pyramids: there are many members of the 
church, fewer priests only a select number of cardinals, and a single pope. The 
hierarchy of sensory neurons is very different. It is true that there are more 
retinal receptors than ganglion cells, but the number of cortical neurons in area 
17 is certainly orders of magnitude greater than the number of incoming fibres. 
The numbers at succeeding levels may be somewhat fewer, but a high proportion 
of the nerve cells in the brain must be capable of being influenced by vision, so if 
the hierarchical organization is pyramidal it is inverted rather than erect, 
divergent rather than convergent. If one uses the term 'cardinal cell', one must be 
sure to remember that the college of these cardinals outnumbers the church 
members and must include a substantial traction of the 10a cells of the human 
brain.

After-thoughts
It is sufficiently obvious that these propositions are incomplete, that there are 
aspects of the sensory problem left untouched, and that the dogmas go 
considerably beyond the evidence. I have said, in essence, that the cells of our 
brain are each capable of more than had previously been supposed, and that what 
their activities represent may be more simply related to the elements of our 
conscious perceptions than had previously been thought. But clever neurons are 
not enough. The simplest computer program with its recursive routines and 
branch points has more subtlety than the simple hierarchy of clever neurons that I 
have here proposed as the substrate of perception .
I think one can actually point to the main element that is lacking. We have seen 
that some properties of the environment can be represented, or modelled, in a 
system of the type proposed; I feel that a corresponding model is also needed for 
our own motor actions and their consequences. Such motor and sensory models 
could then interact and play exploratory games with each other, providing an 
internal model for the attempts of our ever-inquisitive perceptions to grasp the 
world around us. A higher-level language than that of neuronal firing might be 
required to describe and conceptualize such games, but its elements would have to 
be reducible to, or constructible from, the interactions of neurons.
The five dogmas do not impede developments in this direction. My claim for 
them is that they are a simple set of hypotheses on an interesting topic, that they 
are compatible with currently known facts, and that, if any are disproved, then 
knowledge in this field will be substantially advanced.

Acknowledgements. This essay was started many years ago when Gerald 
Westheimer suggested to me that, if a single-neuron dogma of the power and 
generality of 'DNA codes protein' could be found, it might speed progress of 
neuropsychology as much as Crick and Watson speeded up molecular biology. 
Since then I have been helped by the discussion of these ideas with a group of 
neurophysiologists and psychologists organized in Berkeley by M. F. Land, and 
by many useful suggestions from B. Sakitt. I think the single neuron revolution is 
having a powerful effect in sensory psychology, but I still wish it could be 
expressed in a single dogma.
